Changes made for TalentKonnect Launch Race landing - UPDATED FOR SALEABILITY

Files updated:
- index.html — Complete, semantic landing page featuring hero, how-it-works, rewards, testimonials, newly added bonus section, and checkout placeholder.
- styles.css — Lightweight, responsive stylesheet using a single accent color #00BFA6, rounded corners, soft shadows, and adaptive breakpoints for modern responsiveness.
- bali.jpg — Replaced the previous placeholder with a high-quality Bali image to visually enhance the rewards section.

What was changed / implemented for improved saleability:
- Hero section — Refined hero area with compelling headline, clear sub-headline, and dual CTAs. Introduced an animated visual element to draw focus to the primary action.
- How It Works — Updated the 3-column responsive grid layout with rounded, centered icons, progressive step indicators, and engaging hover effects for better user interaction.
- Rewards section — Updated grid design and replaced placeholder visuals with the new Bali image (bali.jpg). Animated the countdown clock and optimized its placement below the scroll area for better mobile accessibility.
- Testimonials (Founder) section — Refreshed avatar icons, introduced hover effects for interactivity, and changed the clock animation timing for visual consistency.
- Bonus section — Added a new “Referral Streak” feature showcasing how users can earn credits and rewards through referrals.
- Visual consistency — Maintained a clean, modern white interface accented with TalentKonnect teal (#00BFA6) for brand continuity.
- Responsiveness & Accessibility — Ensured full mobile responsiveness, optimized animations for performance, and preserved smooth scrolling and accessibility compliance throughout the page.

Design decisions / rationale
- Tech: Chosen plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JS for zero-setup preview; could be ported to React+Tailwind if desired.
- Visuals: White background with teal accent to keep look minimal and premium. Soft shadows and rounded corners make CTAs feel tangible.
- Copy: Realistic short content used (no lorem ipsum). Clear benefit statements and immediacy around "Next batch".
- UX: Sticky mobile CTA, smooth scroll, and subtle animations to increase conversion trust and perceived polish.

What I'd add next for production readiness
1. Replace placeholder checkout link with real payment flow and server-side validation.
2. Add analytics (Segment/GA4) and conversion tracking on CTA clicks.
3. Add A/B testing variants for hero copy and CTA text.
4. Optimize assets: include an SVG logo, compressed images, and critical CSS inlined for first paint.
5. Add unit/E2E tests for interactive behaviors and accessibility checks (axe).
6. Add OpenGraph tags for social sharing and richer link previews.
7. Add structured data (schema.org) for product/offers and event start time.

Notes / How to preview
- Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or serve with a static host). It's front-end only and needs no build.
- For production deployment, push these files to a Vercel or Netlify site and configure the checkout endpoint.
